***Item 1: Business Plan*** 
 
**A. Company Name of Fictitious Company (make it a name you would like --treat this like a real startup). Remember this must be a tech company.**

O A S I S     
     
**B. Long-Term Vision Statement**

1. What are the goals?
Our goal is to give people the best experience when using our VR headsets. We have developed a VR headset with the latest technology, cameras, sensors and software to give our customers a flawless experience when using Oasis VR headsets.
2. Where did your idea come from ( a class, a job, a need)?
There are a lot of great VR headsets out there, but we wanted to take the next big step and bring a new generation of VR headsets that will allow you to do more.
3. What is the purpose, values and mission? List 2 or 3 key questions that will guide the startup's choices. These should be essential questions that serve as touchstones to direct your company's efforts. For instance, how can the startup have an impact? What engages our passions?
What is our passion?
Oasis is not a big company by any means. But we strive to be a company that is willing to listen and work hard to give people what they want. While also working on other important fields and subjects. If we want a better future, we also have to take care of our planet. Which is why we are constantly finding ways to bring our customers new, planet friendly products. And what is the best thing? We do include chargers in our products. 
 What inspires us?
We want to inspire new generations. Teach them that with persistence, determination and hard work we can reach our goals. To show them that failure is not something to be ashamed of, but to learn from. We want to teach the younger generations how to build a better community and a better future. 
 
**C. External opportunities that exist**

- Opportunities like co-marketing (i.e. how your new headphones work great with nike shoes for a great workout)
We can say that we partnered up with google to bring good camera quality and video for our VR headsets and easy to use features with google assistance. 
- Who else can we partner up to help with our product?
We can partner up with social media stars in order to promote and reach a diverse number of audiences. 

- funding opportunities you found (through government, VCs, Angel investors,etc),
- Crowdfunding: 

We can create a presentation for our product and present it to the public in order to create exposure and hype for our product and receive donations from those people who are excited for this product. 

- Government funds: 

We can start our company with the help of government funds. We just have to request one through this website.

- Tv shows: 

Go to the tv show shark tank to expose our product to the public with the popular tv show as well as try to convince one of the “sharks” to invest in our company and help us make our company successful. 
- co-development possibilities with other companies  (maybe you can make a nike version of your headphones)
Partner up with Facebook in order to have a cross-platform. Where people that use our systems can interact with people with facebook’s system and vice versa. 
- Special conferences, trade meetings where you could present your product/service
We can go to the E3 exhibition: E3 is a trade event for the video game industry. The Entertainment Software Association organizes and presents E3, which many developers, publishers, hardware and accessory manufacturers use to introduce and advertise upcoming games and game-related merchandise to retailers and to members of the press. (URL: https://e3expo.com)
- Giveaways, hackathons, promotional deals, etc.
We can have pre-order deals when our product is about to come out. We can also have deals during holidays or black friday.
We can create a website in order for people to see the specs of our products and enter giveaways if they provide us with their information. 
We can go to the “API World 2022 Hackathon” that will happen in October of this year. Here is the link: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/api-world-2022-hackathon-registration-271405580397

Give REAL ideas not fake ones. Mention real companies and provide links to their homepage.   For venture capital (VC) give websites and discuss why THAT VC would be interested in YOUR startup (they specialize in human computing and your headphones would fit the profile of their past investments),  Special conferences & how they fit with YOUR product/service and give URL
 
**D. Teams - Give a picture and a biography for each person in the leadership of your company (which are your groupmates) and discuss their strengths as it relates to the formation of this startup tech company. Read this for a more detailed discussion and example.**

***Item 4: Experimentation and Priorities*** 

Experimentation (to test OKRs of Strategy) - restate your Strategy from the Business Proposal in terms of a series of experiments that the company will perform to test ideas.EXPRESS in DETAIL how you can cheaply create prototype (does not have to be functional...think outside box) to use in your experiments. Tell what TOOLS can you use to create your experiments. Tell how can you involve potential customers in your experiments. These Experiments will implement the measurables to see if you are successfully achieving your goals (OKRs)

- Oasis will have three major keystones in meeting our product protocols the first 3-5 years; announcement of product, double sales by June, triple by the following June and make 100 collaborations with companies, social media etc. For the first major keystone we will do market research and learn about our consumers in order to create a valuable solution. We will pitch to our stakeholders, plan our market strategy and create promotional content such as Facebook, Instagram advertising and Google My Business. 
 
- After planning, we will officially launch Oasis. Based on the consumer feedback and amount of pre-orders Oasis team will see what needs to be improved to fit consumer needs. Oasis’ second objective is to double the amount of pre-sales by June. Basing off our previous pre-sale launch we will strategize around what went well and needs to be altered. The third objective is to triple our product pre-sales by the following June. And lastly have 100 collaborations with social media, companies such as Meta, Playstation etc. 

- To create our prototype with the existing fund Oasis has we will firstly sketch our product details on paper. Mocking up what can be seen through our VR, buttons and how our in screen transitions. Not only will this save money on chip components and other important parts we need for our VR but this prototype will be faster than putting together a product. We can also use an app called Balsamiq to create our prototype. Through this app we can save funds while managing to gain more funds in creating a more advanced prototype and be able to receive consumer feedback quickly. Within creating these prototypes Oasis will hypothesize and test what personal relevance will use our VR such as sleep help or gaming. From there we can change the personal relevance to age group or specific of what can be touched or moved when using the VR. After creating these prototypes, we can collect data at local universities or schools by both the  students and faculty. With the data Oasis can see our next steps in creating a better product. 
 
- Priorities- Give which experiment/hypothesis you will test first --as it is a high priority
Within our prototype launch and consumer feedback, creating our prototype of most used topics with the VR and receiving data from local universities we can see how we can improve our presales. This experiment is a high priority since consumers will stop using Oasis if they find the product not useful in their daily lives. By collecting from universities, we can retrieve data from teens to adults.
